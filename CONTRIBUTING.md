Contributing to Seax
====================

Seax is open-source software, and contributions from anyone interested in assisting with Seax's ongoing development are happily welcomed.

Making a Pull Request
---------------------

If you wish to contribute to Seax, please fork the appropriate Seax repository, make any changes you wish to contribute, and then create a [pull request](https://github.com/MeteorCode/Pathway/pulls) to merge your changes.

Your pull request will be reviewed by the repository maintainer, @hawkw, who will determine whether or not it can be merged. In most cases, if your pull request is not approved, you will be provided with information on why your pull request was not merged and what you should do in order to make it merge-ready.

In order to ensure that the pull request process is as efficient as possible, please run the Seax test suite locally on your development machine to ensure that your contribution builds successfully. Furthermore, please try to provide a detailed explanation of what your pull request adds or fixes, how this is implemented, and why it is necessary. This will make the review process much easier for both the contributor (you) and the repository maintainers. Pull requests that are not adequately described will not be approved to merge.

Ideally, all pull requests should add complete unit tests for all code added. We use [codecov.io](https://codecov.io/github/hawkw/seax) to track the test coverage for all Seax projects. For a pull request to be merged, we require that the _patch coverage_ (the number of added lines covered by tests) of that pull request to be greater than 90%.
